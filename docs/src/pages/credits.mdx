# Credits & Upstream

GoBullMQ is inspired by and modeled after BullMQ making use of the same LUA scripts and Redis data structures while providing a native Go implementation.

- Upstream library: BullMQ (Node.js) â€” https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq
- Main project: https://github.com/Codycody31/gobullmq
 

Many concepts and semantics are intentionally similar to ease adoption. Implementation is native Go with Redis and Lua scripts.

If you use GoBullMQ, consider starring the upstream and this repo.
